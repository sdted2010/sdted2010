- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sdted2010
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning all I can about this AIMSICD app. I've done a lot of reading into it, but still barely got my training wheels off. I have quite a few questions but I don't want to feel like an intruding in on the experienced folks tier/territory. Anyone, please feel free to explain to me how all this works. You won't be insulting my intelligence I really really want to learn this stuff and how to do it on this website platform I don't want to chime in the middle of your discussions out there and be some kind of pest. But when it comes to the subject matter of the AIMSICD app, damn.. I'm almost there and so close to getting the drop on them. All the way to the banana in the tailpipe LMAO. Just need that edge that angle, I'm almost there so close I can taste it
